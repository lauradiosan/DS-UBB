## About projects

The project you have to do is an opportunity to explore an Artificial Intelligence (AI) problem in the context of real data. The project will be evaluated both at the end of the semester and during the semester, when each team will have to present to the teaching staff the corresponding iterations of the application and the related technical report.


**Project components**
- problem definition
- team (max 3 members)
- problem solving by AI-based algorithms
- application development and AI integration
- documentation (report)
- final presentation


**Performance of the AI models**
1. Performance
    - qualitative (errors, accuracy, precision, IoU, Dice, etc.)
    - complexity (time, space/memory, FLOPs, hardware resources, etc.)

    <summary> 3. Emotion recognition in economical behaviours </summary>

### Scop

Development of an intelligent system that allows the identification of emotions in the communications of official persons based on the written text associated with the communication, the vocal message associated with the communication, or the facial expressions of the person delivering the communication. 

### Ideea de baza
It is planned to develop a system with 3 components:
- a component that analyzes emotions in written text
- a component that analyzes emotions in the vocal message
- a component that analyzes emotions in the facial expressions of the person delivering the communication.

In the end, the three components will be merged.

    <summary> 5. Market research </summary>

### Aim 

Word / text completion: as part of the analysis of a credit file, we have the section "competitive environment analysis" in the credit report (as in teh below example). The project aim is to develop an intelligent system that should search the WWW and bring what it finds about the respective field of activity and a few words about what the client actually does. The algorithm should bring what it finds about that market. 

Example for company "XYZ SRL â€“ productia de bauturi alcolice si spirtoase"
